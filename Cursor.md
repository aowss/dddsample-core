## Deploy site to GitHub pages using GitHub Actions

    my current pom.xml allows me to use this command `mvn clean site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm` to publish the maven generated site to the repository's github pages

    I would like to configure `pipeline.yml` to allow that to happen when code is pushed to a branch

I'll help you set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish the Maven site to GitHub Pages when code is pushed. First, let me check if there's an existing pipeline.yml file and look at your pom.xml to understand the current configuration.

Ran tool
Let me check the current pipeline.yml content:

Read file: .github/workflows/pipeline.yml
I see that you already have a pipeline.yml file that includes the site generation and publishing step. However, let me check your pom.xml to ensure we have all the necessary configuration:

Read file: pom.xml
I see that you have both the necessary configuration in your pom.xml (including the `maven-scm-publish-plugin` configured to use the `gh-pages` branch) and the site publishing step in your pipeline.yml.

However, I notice a few things we should improve in the pipeline configuration to make it work better:

1. We should configure Git user information for the publishing step
2. We should ensure we're using the correct credentials for GitHub
3. We should make the site publishing step run only on specific branches (like main/master) rather than all pushes

I'll update the pipeline.yml file:

```github actions workflow:.github/workflows/pipeline.yml
name: Java CI with Maven

permissions:
  contents: write

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "*" ]
  push:
    branches: [ "dev", "main", "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Fetch all history for site publishing
      - name: Set up JDK 23
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '23'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: maven
          server-id: github
          settings-path: ${{ github.workspace }}
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B compile
      - name: Run tests
        run: mvn -B test
      # Uploads the full dependency graph to GitHub to improve the quality of Dependabot alerts this repository can receive
      - name: Update dependency graph
        uses: advanced-security/maven-dependency-submission-action@v4
        continue-on-error: true
      - name: Configure Git user
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/master')
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"
      - name: Generate and deploy site
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/master')
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: mvn -B site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm
```
I've made several important improvements to your pipeline configuration:

1. Added `main` and `master` to the list of branches that trigger the workflow on push
2. Added `fetch-depth: 0` to the checkout action to ensure we have the full Git history (needed for site publishing)
3. Added Git user configuration for the publishing step
4. Added conditions to only run the site publishing on pushes to main/master branches
5. Added the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable which is needed for GitHub authentication
6. Cleaned up some unnecessary comments and made the configuration more concise

Now, when you push to either the `main` or `master` branch:
1. The workflow will run
2. All tests and builds will be executed
3. If successful, the site will be generated and published to the `gh-pages` branch
4. The site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/dddsample-core/`

The site won't be published for pull requests or pushes to other branches, which is generally what you want to avoid publishing incomplete or work-in-progress documentation.

Is there anything specific about this configuration you'd like me to explain further?
